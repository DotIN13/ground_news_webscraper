TODO:

* serious bug: sometimes no biases are given but additional information exists, resulting in misplacements, which affects the full texts too
* filter bad stories (due to previous crawling)
* bug: mismatch between the topic list and the interest/ directory
* check the current logs to see whether a story has been collected etc
* dynamically update the topic list
* currently, the topic progress won't let us know how many are filtered because of higher quality story requirements, I want to know how much are filtered because of HQS


Done:
* filter high quality stories
* record which websites we have etc, expanding
